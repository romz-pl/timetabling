# Timetabling

> **Timetabling** is the allocation, subject to constraints, of given resources to objects being placed in space-time, in such way as to satisfy as nearly as possible a set of desirable objectives.

> An **integer programming problem** is a mathematical optimization or feasibility program in which some or all of the variables are restricted to be integers. In many settings the term refers to integer linear programming (ILP), in which the objective function and the constraints (other than the integer constraints) are linear.
